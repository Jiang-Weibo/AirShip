# AirShip

In 'code' folder, you may find the main source code of this project.

In 'exe' folder, you can play this game immediately.

The following 4 files were written by me:
'EulerGPU.cs'
'EulerSolverComputer.compute'
'WaveGPU.cs'
'WaveSolverComputer.compute'

You can press 'A' 'D' to change the direction of the ship and 'Space' to move the ship.

The time is limited and if you have collisions with the border or barrier, the time will be reduce as a punishment.

You ought to obtain all the crystals and move the ship to the door before time runs out.

You can choose three levels with different degrees of difficulty.
